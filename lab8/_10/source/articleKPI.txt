Abstract
Purpose- There is an increasing concern on the quality of jobs and productivity witnessed in
the flexible employment arrangements. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship
between various flexible employment arrangements and the workplace performance.
Design/Methodology- Home-based working-teleworking, flexible timing and compressed
hours are the main employment types examined using the Workplace Employee Relations
Survey (WERS) over the years 2004 and 2011 in Great Britain. The workplace performance
is measured by two outcomes- the financial performance and labour productivity. First, the
determinants of these flexible employment types are explored. Second, the ordinary least
squares (OLS) method is followed. Third, an instrumental variable (IV) approach is applied
to account for plausible endogeneity and to estimate the causal effects of flexible
employment types on firm performance.
Findings- The findings show a significant and positive relationship between the flexible
employment arrangements and the workplace performance. Education, age, wage, quality of
relations between managers-employees, years of experience, the area of the market the
workplace is operated and the competition are significant factors and are positively
associated with the propensity of the implementation of flexible employment arrangements.
Social Implications- The insights derived from the study can have various profound policy
implications for employees, employers and the society overall, including family-work
balance, coping with family demands, improving the firm performance, reducing traffic
congestion and stress among others.
Originality- It is the first study that explores the relationship between flexible employment
types and workplace performance using an IV approach. This allows us to estimate the causal
effects of flexible employment types and the possible associated social implications.

1. Introduction
The establishment of flexible employment programmes, as a reaction to socio-economic,
demographic and gender role changes, present an increasing popular business practice around
the globe (Lähteenmaäki, 2002; Fernandez-Rios et al., 2005; Kersley et al., 2006; McNall et
al., 2010). For example, Families and Work Institute in the USA reports that the number of
employers offering flexible work arrangements grew from 68% in 1998 to 81% in 2014
(Bond et al., 2005; Matos and Galinsky, 2014). We observe also a similar tendency in
Europe. Plantenga and Remery (2009) showed that over 60% of employees in Europe have
access to flexible working schedules. Work over the last years is disconnected from a
particular place and time. This is explained by the fast boost of the information and
communication technology (ICT). While the traditional places of work used to be the
employer‘s premises, nowadays work is carried out in other locations, such as the employee‘s
home, other remote areas or working while travelling. Advances in technology reshape the
relationship between work and home, where the traditional flow of employees from home to
office is reversed. Since the 1980s, an increasing part of the workforce has been teleworking
at home or in location away from employer‘s premises at least one day a week. This study
aims to explore the effects of three main flexible employment types; the homebased working
–teleworking, flexible timing and compressed hours on firm performance.
Earlier literature has examined the relationship between teleworking, labour outcomes
and work-family balance, but it has not explored the association between flexible
employment schemes and workplace performance in Great Britain and their causal effects.
Previous studies have outlined the reasons for the growth of teleworking and other flexible
employment arrangements owned to their perceived benefits. In particular, these benefits
refer to job satisfaction, productivity, organisational loyalty, improved employee morale and
3
loyalty and savings in space office among others (Bélanger, 1999). Overall, teleworking is
attracting increasing interest from researchers and policy-makers.
The objective of this paper is threefold. First, our aim is to explore the determinants of the
implementation of the above-mentioned flexible employment schemes. Second, to examine
the effects of the flexible employment on the workplace performance. Third, to deepen the
knowledge on factors affecting performance and growth within firms and how these can be
manipulated to improve the workplace performance. Understanding the effects of flexible
labour schemes, not only benefits firms, but the society too. In addition, the findings can
provide insights how to generate labour policies and employment schemes within economies
to sustain and increase the standard of living and the general economic welfare. The analysis
relies on data derived from the Workplace Employment Relations Study (WERS) in Great
Britain over the years 2004 and 2011. Even though, in this study we do not examine the
linkage between the specific working types, workplace performance, job satisfaction and
employee loyalty, we suggest it for future research.
To find the causal effects we apply the instrumental variables (IV) approach. The flexible
working arrangements are instrumented with variables, such as whether the employee has
dependent children and whether he/she takes care of a disabled household member. We
assume that these employees are more likely to request flexible employment arrangements,
without affecting directly the firm performance. The reason we follow the IV approach is the
endogeneity issue coming from the plausible reverse causality between the workplace
performance and the flexible employment arrangements. On the one hand, it could be the
case that these employment arrangements cause workplace performance. On the other hand,
more productive firms may carry out these arrangements and offer them in a larger number of
employees and at a higher frequency or more productive workers may choose those
employment types.

The study finds a positive relationship between flexible employment, the labour
productivity and firm performance. This shows that firms can apply flexible employment
schemes resulting to plausible benefits for both employees and employers. These benefits
include cutting costs for office space, coping with the family demands, improving work-life
balance, and increasing the workplace performance.
The paper is organised as: Section 2 presents a brief literature review. Section 3 presents
the methodology, while in section 4 the survey and variables used in the analysis are
discussed. Section 5 reports the results and section 6 presents the concluding remarks, policy
implications and areas for future research.
2. Literature Review
In this section we present the theoretical framework for the analysis followed in the study.
Next, we discuss previous research studies on the association between flexible employment
schemes and various outcomes, such as productivity, employee loyalty and job satisfaction.
Shockley and Allen (2012) discuss two main motivations that companies offer flexible
employment opportunities and the reasons the employees are likely to implement them. The
first is life-management motives and the second includes the work-related motives. Lifemanagement motives help employees to manage both work and personal life. Studies confirm
that the work-life balance management is a major motivation for employees to use flexible
work arrangements. Typical examples include family demands, such as altering one‘s
schedule to take the children to school, going for shopping or involvement in household
chores. The second category includes the work-related motives, where the flexible
employment arrangements apply to increase one‘s productivity. For example, a person might
work in an office during the hours when the office is empty or work at home listening music.
Another option is to work from a remote area or at home, avoiding commuting time and
5
dividing this extra time to family demands. Earlier studies have examined the work-related
motives less often.
Our empirical analysis is based on a theoretical framework where flexible working
arrangements offer job control and autonomy, improve work-family balance and job
satisfaction resulting to improved productivity. The second framework refers to the boundary
theory and the work-family balance which we discuss next. Researchers have pointed out the
importance of having high perceptions of work control and the individual well-being. Within
this framework, flexible work schedules are interventions which enable greater control to the
employees, providing psychological and tangible resources to enhance well-being (Karasek
and Theorell, 1990; Gronlund, 2007; Kelly and Moen, 2007). The job control refers to when
and where people work. Kelly and Moen (2007) and Kossek et al. (2006) extend the notion of
job control to manage also over how the work is done.
Flexible timing employment scheme offers the control for starting and stopping the work
schedule. Within this scheme the employee can deal with non-labour demands, such as
childcare, household chores and others. With compressed hours scheme, the employee can
arrange non-labour activities during the scheduled fifth day-off. Using teleworking the
employee is able to allocate the time saved from commuting to work into other activities.
Overall, absenteeism is lower for the users of those flexible working arrangements due to the
ability to cluster personal appointments during employee-controlled non-labour time.
According to the expectancy theory developed by Vroom‘s (1964), individuals are more
likely to be motivated to exert effort to perform for valued goals they think they can achieve.
Thus, the theory assumes that people involved in the flexible working arrangements are more
likely to exhibit higher performance, because they would have greater resources, including
extra time and more support. This will enable employees to perform both work and family
roles well (Kossek et al., 2006; Kelly and Moen, 2007; Kossek and Misra, 2008). Earlier
6
research shows that employees may engage in higher extra-role performance when flexibility
is available.
Lambert (2000) found that employees with access to flexible employment schemes
exhibited higher organisational citizenship behaviour, productivity and loyalty. The
hypothesis bolsters that flexible work schedules would lessen work-family conflict,
characterised as when one role interferes with the performance of another role. Use of
flexible schedules could likewise build work-family improvement, how much assets or
abilities or learning in one part e.g. work, enhance the other e.g. family. This shows that users
would have more prominent contribution in both work and family roles. Greenhaus and
Powell (2006) propose that resources in one area will prompt positive spill-over effects in
another domain. They argue that increased flexibility provided by those employment schemes
will have a positive effect on both work and family roles.
The expanded positive mood in every area, thusly, will cross-exchange, and enhance the
overall quality of role experiences at work and home. This belief is related to the boundary
theory, and it assumes that individuals construct physical, mental and emotional fences
between roles, such as work and family (Ashforth, 2001). According to Nippert- Eng (1996)
the degree within which the employees prefer to fragment work and family roles varies.
Flexible work schedules influence employee perceived ability to control limits amongst work
and home. For example, whether and how much the planning and area of work or family
roles are flexible and penetrable (Kossek et al., 2006). Overall, the theoretical framework
described in this section supports the idea that flexible working schedules may improve
productivity and performance through two channels. First, the control over the place, time
and the way the job is done. Second, through the family conflict reduction and improved
well-being that is associated with positive spill-over effects on the job.

Earlier studies found that teleworkers report an increased productivity (Bailey and
Kurland, 2002; Vega et al., 2014). However, a large share of the people reported an increased
number of working hours (Bailey and Kurland, 2002). Aborg et al. (2002), considering
within-person effects of teleworking in two companies, found that teleworking increases
work effectiveness, but this may simultaneously be a result of extensive workload. So,
teleworkers and flex-working employees may exhibit higher levels of job satisfaction because
of the flexibility and work autonomy that these employment types may offer. This leads to
extra work, resulted from the reciprocal behaviour of the flexibility offered by the firm. In
addition, this flexibility may enable them to work harder during the hours spent at home
compared to working hours at the employer‘s premises. The study by Patrickson (2002)
explores whether teleworking offers potential employment opportunities to older people.
While Patrickson (2002) finds that teleworking might appear to offer these opportunities, the
take up rate is rather low. This study explores the association between teleworking and
workplace performance using a sample which includes employees belonging to various age
categories as suggested by Patrickson (2002). Studies in the field of organisational economics
and psychology have further developed and explored the effects of teleworking on working
hours and job satisfaction. Vega et al. (2014) in a within-person study based on five
consecutive working days found that employees, while they telework, are more likely to
report higher levels of job satisfaction and performance. Previous studies also explored the
inclination to opt teleworking, including the paper by Baruch et al. (2000). The authors using
matched employees-employers samples from Hong Kong and United Kingdom found an
increasing inclination to opt for teleworking in both countries.
The second employment mode explored is the flexible timing, a scheme for full time
employees that allows them to choose their starting and finishing time daily. Flexible timing
nowadays is considered as an important part of a work-life balance package. It intends to
8
moderate the negative impacts of the unbending working hour culture, with potential results
for both businesses and employees (Galinsky and Johnson, 1998). Skinner and Pocock (2011)
explored the relationship between flexible timing and the work-life interference using data
from the 2009 Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI) survey. AWALI has information on
the employment, demographic, social and work–life items and questions on employee
requests for flexibility. Their findings show that women were twice as likely as men to seek
flexibility. Firms granted flexible employment arrangements at almost the 20 per cent of the
employees that requested them. Skinner and Pocock (2011) found that the work-life balance
was better than those who did not requested or not fully agreed-granted the specific scheme.
However, managers face challenges about flexible timing. These include the set up and
maintenance of the time-keeping schedule that may lead to additional costs. This employment
arrangement places a burden on the communication, supervision and scheduling of the
employees‘ working time.
The third flexible employment type explored in this study is the compressed hours.
Compressed hours is not a new idea. Molloy, director of the Human Resource (HR) at Marcel
Dekker Inc. states that compressed hours improve the employee morale, enhances
productivity and ultimately increases profitability (Woodward, 2000). Earlier studies show
that the ―compressed hours‖ employment scheme leads to reductions in personal leave time,
sick leave and absenteeism (Eaton, 2003; Halpern, 2005; Hyland, et al., 2005; Skinner and
Pocock, 2011).
Green et al. (2010) examined the flexible working arrangements in 2001-2005 using the
Household Income and Labour Dynamics (HILDA) survey in Australia. The authors found
that the flexible working types are associated with lower perception of job security and lower
payments. However, their analysis is limited to casual workers, who work temporarily having
no permanent or long-term employment agreement. Therefore, we expect a negative
9
association between casual workers and wages because of the uncertainty coming from the
job insecurity and the fixed employment period.
The studies we discussed so far present various limitations. First, the sample used in
every case is small and the analysis relies on cross-sectional data. Additionally, they
investigate the changes on performance and productivity by the teleworking implementation,
but they do not attempt a causal interpretation. Also, the studies are limited in one sector of
economic activity and the factors or controls used are not adequate. For instance, the degree
of competition that firms face from abroad or the domestic market, the market area, the type
of the company and the quality of relations between employees and managers among other
characteristics are not considered. This study extends the previous literature by exploring
three different flexible employment arrangements, and it relies on a panel data of workplaces,
accounting for various factors. Additionally, we apply the two stage least squares (2SLS)
method to explore the causal effects of these employment schemes on the firm performance.
Moreover, the study uses a sample of employees with long-term contracts and not casual
employees, as Green et al. (2010) examined. Overall, less attention is paid in the previous
literature about the role of teleworking, flexible timing and compressed hours and their
implications to the workplace performance. Furthermore, the availability and implementation
of flexible work arrangements may differ according to individual characteristics of the
employees, organisations and sectors. For instance, the age, education level, marital status
can be important factors of propensity to carry out those employment types, but also can be
significant determinants of the firm performance. The status of the company, i.e. public or
private, the competition, the area which is operated, i.e. local, regional or international, the
size, the management-employee relations and the sector can be equally important factors of
performance. Their investigation can offer further insights about the management in the
workplace and their manipulation that may allow for improvement in productivity.

3. Methodology
The following equation for individual i, in firm j, location k and at time t is estimated:
i j k t i j k t i j k t k t j j
T i j k t WP a a FE ΄z l l
, , , 0 1 , , . , , , , , ,
        

(1)
WP denotes the workplace performance, where two alternative measures are used in the
study, financial performance and labour productivity, as we describe them in more details in
the data section. The vector FEi
,j,k,t is a dummy showing whether the respondent i implements
the flexible working arrangement in firm k, in region j and in time t. z is a vector of employee
and firm factors, including gender, age, education, marital status, wage, quality of relations
between employees-managers among others that are discussed and presented in the section of
the empirical results. Set μk denotes the workplace fixed effects, lj is the location fixed effects
expressed by travel to work area (TTWA), θt is a time-specific vector, while ljT is a set of
area-specific linear time trends which controls for unobservable time-varying characteristics
in the TTWA area. TTWAs are designed from the Office for National Statistics used for the
labour market analysis and planning. The areas are designed in such a way that the majority
of the resident population also works within the same area. The criteria for defining and
designing a TTWA is that overall at least the 75 per cent of the people work and live in the
same area.
For notation convenience, individuals, workplaces, location-TTWA and time are defined
in (1) as i, k, j and t respectively, but only the location and workplace fixed effects are
considered, since the sample refers to the same workplaces but different employees. The
main purpose of the study is to explore the flexible employment types controlling for
employees and firm characteristics.
11
The first is the flexible timing and refers to a policy in which the traditional fixed time
that employees start and finish the working day is replaced by a set of rules within which
employees may choose their starting and finishing time (Hicks and Klimoski, 1981; Duncan
and Pettigrew, 2012). Flexible timing allows also the employee to choose how many hours
would like to put on a specific day, while still working five days per week. The second
employment scheme is the compressed hours, where employees are allowed to work ten
hours per day, but four days per week (Baltes et al., 1999). As opposed to the flexible timing,
compressed hours scheme is more popular to the manufacturing companies, rather than in
services. The reason is that compressed workweek enables the employees to follow a certain
schedule, i.e. work at certain allotted time, while granting a degree of flexibility, as to have
three days-off instead of two. Second, opposite to services companies, employees in
manufacturing sector do not have to work always during Monday-Friday at a specific time
interval. So, it is important to control in the regressions for the sector of the workplace
(Baltes et al., 1999). The third is teleworking, where employees are allowed to work at
locations of their choice (Hill et al., 2001; Duncan and Pettigrew, 2012).
We follow an instrumental variable (IV) approach, because of the possible degree of
reverse causality between the workplace performance and the flexible employment
arrangements explored. In this case, we instrument the flexible working with the following
variables: whether the employee has dependent children, and whether the respondent handles
the caring of a disabled person. These variables are not correlated with the workplace
performance as the regression analysis shows. About the determinants of the flexible
working arrangements we will estimate regression (1) where the dependent variable will be
the dummy indicating whether the respondent implements a specific working arrangement.
Since the variable is binary we apply the Logit model, while the results derived from the
Probit model remain similar.
12
4. Data
The Workplace Employment Relations Study (WERS) series have started in 1980 and
have taken place six times until 2011. In this study, we consider the 2004 and 2011 survey
which took place in a random sub-sample of workplaces and it was conducted to managers
and employees. The survey population for both the 2004 and 2011 WERS includes a sample
of British workplaces with at least 5 employees. It comprises four main sections: the
Employee Questionnaire, the Worker Representative Questionnaire, the Financial
Performance Questionnaire and the Management Questionnaire. Employee Questionnaire
includes information on employee characteristics while the last three provide information
about the firm-establishment. This is useful for the analysis since the regressions control for
both employee and workplace characteristics. In addition, the analysis of the surveys of 2004
and 2011 allow us to control for unobserved characteristics of the pre-financial crisis period
and the economic shocks after 2008. We should note that we take the specific years because
it is a panel dataset for workplaces, but not for employees. We could have considered more
years, including the surveys of 1990 and 1998, but this does not allow us to estimate the
model using firm fixed effects.
We explore the relationship between the flexible employment arrangements and two
measures of workplace performance. These include the financial performance and labour
productivity. The measures are derived from the Management Questionnaire and they
answer in the following question ―How would you assess your workplace‘s financial
performance and labour productivity?‖ Then the interviewer asked the management
representative to write down in which of the following categories the measures fall into: a lot
better than average; better than average; about average; below average or a lot below average.
Thus, the measures are ordered variables ranging between 1 (very good) to 5 (very low). A
13
negative coefficient sign would show an improvement on the firm-workplace performance.
To interpret the results easier, we recoded the measures in a way that 1 indicates very low (a
lot below average) and 5 very high (a lot better than average).
One major drawback of the analysis is the reliability of the self-reported outcomes
explored in the study. Earlier studies have raised this issue, especially in the economics of
well-being. The issue is related with unobserved heterogeneity and since these measures are
self-assessed on an arbitrary scale, they can suffer from differential item functioning (DIF).
This makes the assumption of interpersonal comparisons potentially difficult (see Kapteyn et
al., 2010 for more details). Anchoring vignettes proposed by King et al. (2004) is an
alternative approach; but it is impossible with the current dataset, because the necessary
information is missed. Even though the regressions account for workplace fixed effects, the
answers are still given by the manager. For instance the 5 for a person A can be equivalent
with 3 for the person B, which makes the comparison between individuals unreliable. With
the fixed effects, however, the analysis takes place within and not between managers. Since
the scale of the manager‘s opinion does not change, this can lead to more robust estimates.
In table 1 we report the summary statistics for the main variables of interest, such as the
workplace performance and the proportions of the flexible working arrangement. We observe
that the average values of workplace performance are rather high in a scale 1-5 and the
average values are almost 3.5. The 16 per cent of the sample is involved on teleworking, 21
on flexible timing. Almost the 27 per cent of the sample is choosing compressed hours as a
working type.
The proportions of the instrumental variables are presented, because are the main
variables of interest. While the 12.00 per cent of the sample has a dependent child aged 0-2
years, almost the 70.00 per cent has a dependent child which is older than 2 years. About
whether the employee is caring a disabled member the majority of the respondents answered
14
―no‖ at around 82 per cent. The 8.38 per cent is devoting 0-4 hours per week, the 4.25 per
cent spends 5-9 hours. The remained almost 5.5 per cent is taking care of a family member
more than 9 hours per week.
In table 2 we present the correlation between the flexible employment types explored, the
workplace performance, and selected control variables. A significant correlation among the
variables of interest and other control variables used into the regressions may be present.
However, since the number of controls is large, their correlation is not reported, but we
discuss their association in the empirical results section. In addition, we present the candidate
instrumental variables; whether the employee is caring a disabled member, whether he/she
has a dependent child of 0-2 years old and dependent child older than 2 years old. The
purpose of reporting the instrumental variables used in this study is to confirm if they are
correlated with the flexible employment types and the workplace performance measures.
A positive and significant association among teleworking, compressed hours, and
workplace performance measures, education, age and the instrumental variables is observed.
Flexible timing is only significantly correlated to the labour productivity. Males are more
likely to be older and earn more than women. Also, they are more likely to have a dependent
child older than 2 years and are less likely to have a dependent child aged 0-2 years.
However, as we observe in table 2 the correlation between the flexible employment schemes
and wage is mixed. More specifically, while the relationship is positive and significant for
teleworking, it becomes negative for compressed hours scheme. On the other hand, the
relationship between the flexible timing scheme and wage is insignificant. Old aged are less
likely to have a dependent child 0-2 years old. Age and the frequency of taking care of a
disabled member and having dependent child older than 2 years is positive. Therefore,
according to table 2 teleworking and compressed hours are instrumented with the case where
15
the employees taking care of a disabled member, and having a dependent child. Flexible
timing is instrumented only with the cases whether the employees have a dependent child.
5. Empirical Results
In table 3 we present the factors that determine the propensity to implement the flexible
working arrangements. The results overall show that the association among education level,
teleworking and compressed hours is positive, while the relationship between wage and
flexible timing is insignificant. Age and education level present a negative propensity to carry
out the compressed hours. Divorced employees are more likely to follow teleworking, while
married and widowed are less likely to choose the compressed hours as an employment
scheme. About gender, males are more likely to choose flexible timing and compressed hours
and females to choose teleworking.
Workplaces that operate in larger areas than local, face international competition and are
not public are more likely to implement the flexible employment types explored in this study.
Also, the results show that the quality of relations between managers and employees is an
important factor of the flexible work implementation, except for compressed hours.
Employees with many years of experience and the size of the workplace affect in a positive
way the probability occurrence of implementing the flexible employment arrangements.
Supervision of other employees has a significant and positive effect on teleworking and
compressed hours. Whether the employee has a child and whether he/she cares a disabled
member, the probability of implementing the flexible employment types is positive. The
exception is the flexible timing as we have shown also in the correlation matrix in table 2.
About the workplace type, employees in the private companies are more likely to implement
those types of employment schemes, except for compressed hours, where the association is
16
significant and negative. The results show that the competition encourages the flexible
employment implementation.
The findings overall are consistent with other studies where performance-related
schemes, the market area, quality of managers-employee relationships, and wage among
others are significant factors for workplace performance (Hatton, 1988; Jones and Kato,
1995; Brown and Heywood, 2002). In addition, Green et al. (2010) found that employment
types, such as casual employees are connected with low payments and low levels of job
security. The analysis explores whether the flexible employment arrangements explored in
this paper, are related to the workplace performance. The positive effects can be explained
because employees are happy as they can cope with the household and family demands, and
they may spend more time on leisure activities.
(Insert Table 3)
In table 4 we present the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression estimates. We should
notice that we could have applied the ordered Probit or Logit models. However, since we
follow the IV approach, we prefer the OLS method to make the estimates comparable.
Previous studies have applied OLS concluding that the estimates are similar (Clark and
Oswald, 1996; Ahn and García, 2004; Giovanis, 2014; Giovanis and Ozdamar, 2016).
Another option is the ―Probit OLS (POLS)‖ approach developed by Van Praag and Ferrer-iCarbonnell (2006), which presents very similar estimates with those derived by OLS. This
approach is useful for panel data when fixed effects models are needed since the ordered
Logit and Probit models allow only for random effects estimations. Yet, the endogeneity and
self-selection issues are not solved by this method.
In table 4 the results show that the association between employment schemes explored
and the workplace performance measures is positive and significant. The exception is the
17
flexible timing whose effect on financial performance is insignificant while it becomes
significant and positive when we consider the labour productivity. The wage coefficients are
significant and positive. Age, education and marital status have no significant effect on the
measures of the workplace performance examined. An exception is the education level where
those with higher degree are more likely to have a positive impact on the workplace
performance. In addition, married and men who implement teleworking and flexible timing
are more productive.
The status of the workplace and the market area that it is operated are significant factors
of workplace performance. According to the findings, the larger the area, the greater the
performance is likely to be. The quality of relations between managers and employees and
the performance-related schemes present a positive relationship with the workplace
performance. The status of the workplace is significant where in the majority all the types of
firms are more productive relative on the reference category which is the public firms.
Overall, so far the findings suggest that the flexible working arrangements we study here,
can have benefits for the firms and their performance. Additionally, we conclude that welleducated and married people, the performance-related schemes and the quality of the
management-employees relations are major factors contributing to the workplace
performance. Thus, we suggest that companies should invest on any kind of flexible
employment arrangements, and to quality of personnel relations. Even companies that are
operated in small geographical and market area, with small number of skilled employees, can
benefit from the practice of flexible employment.
In table 5 we report the 2SLS estimates. We instrument teleworking and compressed
hours with the variable on whether the employee has dependent children 0-2 years old,
dependent children older than 2 years and whether the respondent taking care of a disabled
person in the household. For flexible timing we take as instrument the case where the
18
respondent has a dependent child. These factors can be highly correlated with the
employment types, because they allow them to spend more time at home working and taking
care of the children and disabled household members. As we see from the results in table 5,
the causal effects of the employment types on workplace performance are confirmed.
However the effects are higher than those found in table 4, by 20-60 per cent. This shows that
the estimates derived by the OLS are underestimated because of the possible reverse causality
we mentioned in the earlier sections. According to the weak instrument test, we reject the
null hypothesis and we conclude that the instrument variables are not weak. In addition,
based on the Sargan endogeneity test, we accept the null hypothesis of no-endogeneity.

While policies are commonly embraced at the organisational level, inside firms, there is
frequently wide variety and organisational stratification in which diverse employments, work
groups, and workforce demographics have access to schedules. Relatively little research has
been carried out at the work group level of analysis. A review by Van Dyne et al. (2007)
shows that motivation and coordinating effects of flexible schedules were the main
fundamental implementation challenges at the work group level. Managers able to manage
coordination of work schedules effectively are more likely to experience positive work group
performance impact. To facilitate this, is critical for the firms to allocate resources to train
managers and employees to learn how to work in new scheduling forms (Lautsch and
Kossek, 2009; Kossek and Hammer, 2008). Our results confirm a part of the story. As we
have shown, when the relations between managers and employees is good, the employees are
more likely to use the flexible employment schemes, controlling for other employee and
workplace characteristics. Additionally, the quality of the relations between employee and
manager is a significant factor of the firm performance. New management training and
19
organisational culture change interventions are being designed to increase employee control
over work schedules (Kossek and Hammer, 2008; Kelly and Moen, 2007). The expansion of
supervising backing and the promotion of cultural support for workplace flexibility will allow
employees to have more control over work schedules, reduce work-family conflicts, and
ultimately improve family well-being, and organisational productivity and performance.
Thus, the conclusion is that these employment arrangements may be an efficient policy,
especially when the employees have the option to choose their implementation with various
plausible benefits to workplace, including costs saving and improved productivity. On the
other hand, the benefits for the employees, besides the plausible performance payments and
other related benefits, can be job satisfaction improvement, ability to cope with their family
demands, resulting to improvement of their work-family balance and their overall well-being.
Additionally, it is hopeful that this research may offer insights to decision makers related to
the human resource policies review to adopt and implement them as they may improve the
firm performance. This may result from various factors, including employee engagement and
loyalty, job satisfaction, work autonomy, work-life balance and others. Therefore, this study
proposes to further explore all these interrelationships, accounting for the flexible labour
schemes. Having also in mind that their implementation can be not very costly, is another
motivation for the firms. Furthermore, the findings of this research are in complete
accordance to those of other research studies conducted in different countries (Hatton, 1988;
Jones and Kato, 1995; Woodward, 2000; Brown and Heywood, 2002; Halpern, 2005; Skinner
and Pocock, 2011). The difference lies that we have used a large panel dataset over a
representative sample of the complete sectors of economic activity. Also, we applied 2SLS to
identify their causal effects. However, the research faces limitations in any form, due to
imperfect data as a firm panel dataset and not employee. Another issue is the reliability of the
20
outcome measures which are self-reported answers on questions related to the financial
performance and labour productivity of the workplace.
6. Conclusions
Flexible work arrangements for a long time have been a popular tool to manage work and
life balance. The need to manage work and life obligations has become exponentially
significant in the last years, following socio-economic and demographic changes between the
couples. This study explored the relationship between three flexible employment
arrangements and the workplace performance. The findings suggest that there is a positive
effect of teleworking and compressed hours on the workplace performance while the flexible
timing positively affects only the labour productivity. We confirm these results by the 2SLS.
Overall, the findings indicate that the specific employment modes may have various benefits
and policy implications for both employees and employers and for the society overall. On the
one hand, for the employers a higher performance and productivity level may lead to profit
increase and further growth. This can be reflected by increases on wages, and improvement
on relations quality among the personnel in the workplace. Moreover, companies can lease a
smaller number of offices and equipment resulting to cost savings. The benefits for the
employees can be various, including relief from stress which is related to traffic congestion
and commuting at work. Flexible employment arrangements may offer more work autonomy
and control of the working schedule. Furthermore, they may allow the employees to cope
with the family and household demands and to devote more time on leisure activities. The
latter may have additional effects on productivity through the improvement of job satisfaction
and quality of life. We have not explored well-being in this study; however, we suggest it for
future research. The benefits for the society include the social welfare for the employees and
21
employers and other plausible benefits, such as the traffic and air pollution reduction and
overall well-being improvement.
